# CV Experiments

A repo for experimenting in Computer Vision.
Currently mostly covers classification with a little bit of detection.

# Requirements

* PyTorch 1.5.0
* Torchvision 0.6.0
* Nvidia Dali 0.21.0
* Weights and Biases Library
* PyTorch Lightining
* Ablumentations

# Notes

Models follow the coding structure of torchvision models
some data pipelines leverage Nvidia DALI and APEX libraries

Main entry point is via the train_xxx scripts

# ToDo

Test Hyperparam Tuning
Incorporate some Viewing results notebooks for trained models
