# CV Experiments

A repo for experimenting in Computer Vision.
Currently mostly covers classification with a little bit of detection.

# Requirements

* PyTorch 1.7.0
* Torchvision 0.8.0
* Nvidia Dali 0.21.0
* Weights and Biases Library
* PyTorch Lightining 1.1.2
* Ablumentations

# Notes

Models follow the coding structure of torchvision models
some data pipelines leverage Nvidia DALI and APEX libraries

Main entry point is via the train_xxx scripts

To only use certain GPUs

```{bash}

# x is the gpu number
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=x python train_classification_lightning.py 

```

# ToDo

Test Hyperparam Tuning
Incorporate some Viewing results notebooks for trained models
