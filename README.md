# CV Experiments

A repo for experimenting in Computer Vision

# Notes

Data is in a folder that is external to this.
For image classification datasets, the folder structure is
* cv_data/*dataset*/train/*class*/*filename*
* cv_data/*dataset*/test/*class*/*filename*


# TODO

Investigate how to train detection algorithms properly
Can we make a template for a series of detection algorithms?

Targets:
* Faster-RCNN
* YoloV3
